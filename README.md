# TTE
A terminal text editor, designed for people who want gedit/notepad from the CLI!!

Very much WIP, hope to fix that

Design:
Uses a 2D linked list as a text buffer to store the data 
Runs from the CLI

TODO:
Important:
Refactor code so it's simpler
Implement opimization techniques (I.E holding onto addresses that'll likely be used again)
Implement text insertion
Implement text deletion 
Implement saving and deletion prompts 
Implement copy, cut and paste 
Implement opening via CLI arguments

Moderate:
Implement a line numbers
Implement some indicator of how large the file is
Write an install script
